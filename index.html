<div id="title">Does the House of Representatives reflect the popular vote?</div><br>
<div>In this visualization, the party distribution of representatives is visualized along with the distribution of popular vote to show the failure of our political situation to accurately reflect the popular vote. This is still a demo; a complete version would have data from all 50 states and segment each bar based on the number of Representatives allocated to each state. The currently selected states represent the commonly considered three most gerrymandered states. The election data was taken from the Associated Press.</div><br>
